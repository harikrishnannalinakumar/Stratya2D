# Straya2D - Kinematic Decompaction and Backstripping

Straya2D enhances traditional basin analysis by extending 1D decompaction and backstripping methodologies to a 2D framework using seismic cross-sections. This Python-based tool leverages image processing techniques to integrate horizon extraction, depth normalisation, and Monte Carlo Simulation for uncertainty quantification.

## Features

- **Horizon Extraction**: Automatically extracts and processes seismic horizons from PNG or JPEG images.
- **2D Decompaction and Backstripping**: Calculates changes in depositional thickness over time across a 2D seismic cross-section.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Quantifies uncertainties in tectonic subsidence and depositional thickness.
- **Visualisation**: Provides dynamic 2D visualizations of basin evolution and horizon dynamics.
